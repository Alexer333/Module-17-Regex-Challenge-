  A tutorial I have made that goes over what regexes are! Written in gist.md. 
This tutorial goes in-depth on regexes and explains the regex /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ going over each individual segment of it and what they do. 
This example regex was given to me by my professor as one of the example regexes to go over for this assignment.
